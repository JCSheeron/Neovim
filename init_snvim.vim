" ---------------------- USABILITY CONFIGURATION ----------------------
"  Minimal config file intended to be used with the snvim bash script
"  The script controls the making of the .orig file so empty .orig
"  files are not made when the file did not exist to begin with.

" don't make vim compatible with vi, otherwise it conflicts with Vundle and
" other plugins
set nocompatible

" **** General behavior -- things most likely to be edited early in the file

" Change the leader key -- default is "\"
" Do this first early so references below use the new leader
let mapleader = ","

" set how many lines to read variables from
set modelines=0

" setup backup and swap related settings
set backup
set swapfile
set backupext=.bak
set undodir=/home/vmuser1/.config/nvim/.undo//
set backupdir=/home/vmuser1/.config/nvim/.backup//
set directory=/home/vmuser1/.config/nvim/.swap//
" make the first backup special
" Prevent vim from making the .orig file -- the bash script will do this
"set patchmode=.orig

" turn on syntax highlighting
syntax on

" show line numbers
set number

" show file stats
set ruler

" status bar
set laststatus=2 

" last line
" showmode i snot needed with lightline
set showmode
"set noshowmode  not using lightline
set showcmd

" help quick screen redraw
set ttyfast

" screen will not be redrawn while running macros, registers or other
" non-typed comments
set lazyredraw

" enable mouse support for scrolling
set mouse=a

" make a mark for column 80, but wrap after 120 columnns
" Filetype specifics are set below
set colorcolumn=80
set textwidth=120
" set wrap on by default
set wrap

" by default, in insert mode backspace won't delete over line breaks, or 
" automatically-inserted indentation, let's change that
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" Blink cursor on error instead of beeping (grrr)
" set visualbell

" reload files changed outside vim
set autoread         

" use the system clipboard
set clipboard=unnamedplus

" allow hidden buffers -- dont't unload buffers when they are abandoned
" instead stay in the background
set hidden

" keep the cursor visible within 3 lines when scrolling
set scrolloff=3

" turn on spell check
set spell spelllang=en_us

" underline the line the cursor is on
" Cursor highlight taken care of by color scheme
set cursorline

" Open splits on the bottom and right. Default is above and left
set splitbelow
set splitright 

" **** Command mapping
" Allow saving of files as sudo when I forgot to open them as sudo.
" This sends the buffer contents to the shell command tee which is run as sudo,
" and writes the buffer to the current file name
cmap Sw w !sudo tee > /dev/null %

" **** Key mapping
"
" FOR TRAINING, Remap arrow keys in normal mode to not do anyting... at least for now
noremap <Up> <nop>
noremap <Down> <nop>
noremap <Left> <nop>
noremap <Right> <nop>

" remap the escape key to something easier to reach
" there will be a slight pause after the first 'j' waiting for the next one
" but this is visual, and should not cause a typing issue
" Go to normal (command) mode and eat up the moving back of the cursor.
imap jj <Esc>l
" Eat up the moving back of the cursor when going to normal (command) mode.
" This is commented out, because it causes letters to be printed when the arrow
" keys are pressed.
"imap <Esc> <Esc>l

" map <leader>O in normal modde to insert a line above without staying in insert mode
" map <leader>o in normal mode to insert a line below without staying in insert mode
nmap <leader>O O<Esc>
nmap <leader>o o<Esc>

" Make navigation for split windows easier
" Use the normal navigation keys and Ctrl
nnoremap <C-J> <C-W><C-J>
nnoremap <C-K> <C-W><C-K>
nnoremap <C-L> <C-W><C-L>
nnoremap <C-H> <C-W><C-H>

" opening additional buffers (files)
map <leader>e :e <C-R>=expand("%:p:h") . "/" <CR>
map <leader>t :tabe <C-R>=expand("%:p:h") . "/" <CR>
map <leader>s :vsp <C-R>=expand("%:p:h") . "/" <CR>

" List contents of all registers (that typically contain pasteable text).
" i.e. shortcut for :reg/:registers
nnoremap <silent> "" :registers ".0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-*+%/#<CR>

" **** Formatting
" Indentation
set expandtab       " use spaces instead of tabs
set autoindent      " autoindent based on line above, works most of the time
set smartindent     " smarter indent for C-like languages
" default to 4 tabs.  File specific settings below
set shiftwidth=4    " when reading, tabs are 4 spaces
set softtabstop=4   " in insert mode, tabs are 4 spaces
set tabstop=4

" set unix line endings
set fileformat=unix
" when reading files try unix line endings then dos, also use unix for new
" buffers
set fileformats=unix,dos

" **** Color scheme (terminal)
set background=dark
colorscheme desert
