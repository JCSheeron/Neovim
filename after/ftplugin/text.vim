" - c : do not automatically insert the comment leader when wrapping based on
"    'textwidth'
" - o : do not insert the comment leader when using 'o' or 'O' from command mode
" - q :	Allow formatting of comments with 'gq'.

" - r : do not insert the comment leader when hitting <Enter> in insert mode

"	automatically format it.
